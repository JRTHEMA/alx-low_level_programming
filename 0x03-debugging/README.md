0x03. C - Debugging

0. Multiple mains
In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:
Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

You are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.

1. Like, comment, subscribe
Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

2. 0 > 972?
Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

3. Leap year
Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
